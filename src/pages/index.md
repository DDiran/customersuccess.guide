**Welcome to the Customer Success Guide. This is an Open Source repository managed by [David D Lawson](https://ddlawson.com) that contains the resources that Customer Success Professionals will need in their journey of building their careers.**

This guide is what I wish I had when I was first starting out. By assimilating the knowledge and experience of the Customer Success community, we can create a comprehensive resource that will help everyone from novices to veterans excel at their roles.

## How to use this guide

This comprehensive resource is designed to take you from the basics to advanced topics in Customer Success, specifically for B2B SaaS organisations. This guide aims to provide valuable insights and practical knowledge for all experience levels.

### Guide Structure

The guide is divided into 6 high-level modules, each focusing on a different aspect of Customer Success:

1. Introduction to Customer Success
2. Fundamental Concepts to Get Started
3. Customer Success Metrics & KPIs
4. Account Management & Growth Strategies
5. Building & Scaling Customer Success Teams (Coming Soon)
6. Advanced Strategies

#### 1. Following the Guide Step-by-Step

If you're new to Customer Success or want a comprehensive understanding, we recommend following the modules in the order they're presented. This will ensure a smooth learning experience, building on your knowledge from one module to the next.

#### 2. Jumping to Specific Resources

For those who are already familiar with certain aspects of Customer Success or have specific needs, feel free to jump to any module that interests you. Each module is designed to be self-contained, so you can easily focus on the topics that are most relevant to you.

### Navigating the Guide

To help you navigate the guide, we've included a left-hand navigation menu that allows you to switch between modules easily. On desktop, you'll also find a right-hand navigation menu, which enables you to jump between chapters and topics within each module.
