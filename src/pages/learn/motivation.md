description: Why this guide was created.

This guide was created to address a common challenge faced by Customer Success professionals seeking guidance or specific information in their roles. Often, finding answers to specific questions requires extensive searching, and even then, the exact piece of advice needed may be hidden within a podcast transcript.

To overcome this challenge, we have developed a comprehensive, single-source repository for all things related to community building. Each resource is tagged and categorized for easy access. As the repository grows, it will offer a curated list of community resources segmented into relevant groups. The entire collection is searchable, enabling users to quickly find best practices related to their specific needs, review the content, and decide on the next steps to take.

During the development of this guide, we have drawn from a wealth of resources, including over 40 podcasts, more than 100 articles, and three whitepapers on community building. We will continue to update this space with valuable, value-packed community content.

If you would like to have your talk covered in this guide, please reach out to us on Twitter. We always appreciate comments and feedback, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts with us.
