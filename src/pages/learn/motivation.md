This guide was created to address some of the common challenges faced by both Customer Success professionals and leaders who are seeking actionable guidance in their roles. {% .lead %}

Often, finding answers to specific questions requires extensive searching, and even then, the exact piece of advice needed may be hidden within an obscure chapter of a book, or a podcast transcript.

To overcome this challenge, I have decided to develop a comprehensive, single-source repository for all things related to Customer Success. Each resource will be tagged and categorized for easy access.

As the repository grows, it will offer a curated list of Customer Success resources segmented into relevant groups. The entire collection is searchable, enabling users to quickly find best practices related to their specific needs, review the content, and decide on the next steps to take.

During the development of this guide, I plan to drawn from a wealth of resources, including over 20+ podcasts, more than 200 articles, five whitepapers and three books on Customer Success & Leadership. I will continue to update this space with valuable, actionable CS content.

If you would like to have your content covered in this guide, please [get in touch](mailto:contact@customersuccess.guide). I always appreciate comments and feedback, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.
