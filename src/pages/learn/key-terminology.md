It's **essential** to understand with the key terms that drive both Customer Success and SaaS companies overall (the two are strongly interlinked).

Below, you'll find a list of the most important terms, but in future I will be building out a complete glossary and refining and prioritising this list:

1.  **Customer Success:** As the cornerstone of this field, it's crucial to understand that customer success is a proactive approach to ensuring customers achieve their desired outcomes with your product or service, fostering long-term relationships and loyalty.
2.  **Customer Success Manager (CSM):** A CSM is responsible for understanding customer needs, developing and implementing customer success plans, monitoring customer progress, and serving as the main point of contact for customers. They play a vital role in driving customer success.
3.  **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** CLV is a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. It helps businesses understand the value of retaining customers and investing in customer success.
4.  **Churn Rate:** This refers to the percentage of customers who discontinue their subscription to a service over a specific period. A high churn rate can negatively impact revenue, making it essential to minimize churn through effective customer success strategies.
5.  **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** NPS is a metric used to gauge customer satisfaction and loyalty by asking customers how likely they are to recommend your product or service to others. It's an essential indicator of customer success effectiveness.
6.  **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Score:** This metric measures the degree to which customers are satisfied with your product or service. A high CSAT score can indicate that your customer success efforts are working well.
7.  **Onboarding:** Onboarding is the process of helping new customers learn how to use your product or service effectively. A smooth onboarding experience is crucial for setting the stage for customer success.
8.  **Adoption:** Adoption refers to the extent to which customers integrate your product or service into their workflow or lifestyle. High adoption rates indicate that customers are finding value in your offering and are more likely to succeed.
9.  **Upselling and Cross-selling:** Upselling involves encouraging customers to purchase a higher-priced product or service, while cross-selling refers to promoting additional products or services to existing customers. Both strategies can drive revenue growth when executed effectively as part of a customer success strategy.
10. **Customer Journey Map:** This visual representation of the different stages a customer goes through when interacting with your business can help you identify key touchpoints and opportunities to engage with customers and provide the support they need to succeed.
11. **Net Revenue Retention (NRR):** NRR is a crucial metric for SaaS businesses, as it measures the revenue retained from existing customers over a specific period, accounting for upsells, cross-sells, and churn. A high NRR indicates a healthy business with a strong customer success strategy.
12. **Customer Health Score:** This metric provides an overall assessment of a customer's likelihood of success and their potential risk for churn. It's calculated using various factors, such as product usage, engagement, and satisfaction levels.
13. **Customer Segmentation:** The process of dividing your customer base into smaller groups based on shared characteristics, such as industry, company size, or product usage. Customer segmentation enables you to tailor your customer success strategies and resources more effectively.
14. **Customer Success Plan (CSP):** A CSP is a tailored roadmap that outlines the steps and resources needed for a specific customer to achieve their desired outcomes with your product or service. It's a critical tool for CSMs to guide customers toward success.
15. **Voice of the Customer (VoC):** VoC refers to the process of collecting and analyzing customer feedback to gain insights into their experiences, needs, and expectations. It's essential for shaping your customer success strategy and driving continuous improvement.
16. **Quarterly Business Review (QBR):** A QBR is a periodic meeting between a CSM and a customer to review progress, address concerns, and set goals for the upcoming quarter. QBRs help maintain strong customer relationships and ensure alignment on objectives.
17. **Customer Advocacy:** The stage in the customer journey where a customer becomes a loyal advocate for your brand, promoting your product or service to others through word-of-mouth marketing or testimonials. Customer success plays a crucial role in creating customer advocates.
18. **Customer Retention Rate:** This metric represents the percentage of customers who continue using your product or service over a specific period. A high retention rate is indicative of effective customer success strategies that keep customers engaged and satisfied.
19. **Time-to-Value (TTV):** TTV measures the time it takes for customers to realize the full value of your product or service after purchase. Reducing TTV through efficient onboarding and support can improve customer satisfaction and drive success.
20. **Renewal Rate:** The percentage of customers who choose to renew their subscription or contract at the end of its term. A high renewal rate signifies that customers find value in your product or service, which is a key objective of customer success.

By understanding these key terms and their importance, you'll be better equipped to navigate Customer Success landscape.
